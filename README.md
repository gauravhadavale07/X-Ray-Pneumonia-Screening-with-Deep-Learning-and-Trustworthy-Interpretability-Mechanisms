# X-Ray-Pneumonia-Screening-with-Deep-Learning-and-Trustworthy-Interpretability-Mechanisms
Built an X-ray pneumonia classifier using DenseNet, ResNet, and IMPACTX with GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, AblationCAM, and RISE to audit model behavior. Exposed confounders like R/L markers and scanner artifacts, ensuring the network’s attention aligned with real pulmonary pathology.
