Built an X-ray pneumonia classifier using DenseNet, ResNet, and IMPACTX with GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, AblationCAM, and RISE for rigorous model auditing. Identified confounders such as R/L markers and scanner artifacts, enforced pathology-aligned attention, and evaluated explanation reliability using multi-CAM consistency and robustness checks.
